👋 Hi, I’m @edzz-lawliet (Edz Sagabaen)
👀 I’m interested in software development, web technologies, and solving real-world problems through code.
🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL), and diving deeper into C and Java programming.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to HR management systems, data security, and web application development.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at edzsagabaen@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring new frameworks and tools, and I can spend hours debugging code without noticing time passing!
